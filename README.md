# 🖥️ CodeExecutor-API

A professional, layered-architecture API for dynamic code execution. This project allows you to run code in multiple languages against database-backed problems and test cases. 🚀🧪

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before embarking on this journey, ensure your machine is equipped with:
- 🐳 **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- 🐳 **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get your own instance of **CodeExecutor-API** up and running in minutes!

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone this project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saannddy/CodeExecutor-API
cd CodeExecutor-API
```

### 2️⃣ Configure Environment ⚙️
The project uses a `.env` file for configuration. Copy the example to get started:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(You can tweak the `DATABASE_URL` or ports inside `.env` if needed, but defaults work perfectly!)*

### 3️⃣ Build and Launch 🏗️
Run the entire stack (API + PostgreSQL DB) using Docker Compose:
```bash
## FOR LOCAL DB
docker compose --profile local up -d --build
## FOR PRODUCTION
docker compose --profile remote up -d --build
```
- `-d`: Runs containers in the background (**detached mode**).
- `--build`: Ensures all recent code changes are freshly compiled.

### 5️⃣ Automatic Initialization 🪄
On the very first run, the system will automatically:
- Create all database tables (using UUIDs for safety).
- Seed **7+ coding problems** (Two Sum, Palindrome, etc.).
- Link problems with their respective categories and tags.

---

## 🏗️ Database Management
While the system handles initialization automatically, you may need these manual commands for development:

### 🔄 Migrations (Alembic)
If you modify the models in `src/models/`, use these commands to sync the database:
- **Check Status**: `docker compose --profile local exec code-api alembic current`
- **Apply Migrations**: `docker compose --profile local exec code-api alembic upgrade head`
- **Generate New Migration**:
  ```bash
  docker compose --profile local exec code-api alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description_of_change"
  ```

### 🌱 Data Seeding
If you need to re-seed or reset the initial data:
- **Run Seeder**: `docker compose --profile local exec code-api python3 -m scripts.seed`
*(The seeder is idempotent and will skip problems that already exist!)*

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are organized by feature group in the `tests/` directory:

```
tests/
├── conftest.py           # Shared fixtures (Flask client, DB mocks)
├── problem/              # Problem endpoint tests
│   └── test_problem_handler.py
├── question/             # Question endpoint tests
├── riddle/               # Riddle endpoint tests
├── execution/            # Code execution tests
└── docs/                 # Documentation endpoint tests
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

### Coverage Report
After running tests, open the interactive HTML coverage report:
```bash
open coverage_html/index.html
```
The report highlights **exactly which lines** were hit or missed during testing — click any file to see line-by-line coverage.

### Run a Specific Test Group
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/problem/       # Problem tests only
python3 -m pytest tests/riddle/        # Riddle tests only
```

> **Note**: Tests mock the database layer so they run locally without Postgres. Install test dependencies first: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`

## 📝 Usage Best Practices
- 💡 **4 Spaces**: Always use spaces instead of tabs in your JSON `code` strings.
- ⏱️ **Timeouts**: Most problems are capped at 5 seconds for safety.
- 🔒 **Sandboxing**: Code runs in a dedicated non-root container environment.

Build with focus on **Modular, Scalable, and Professional** architecture. ✨
